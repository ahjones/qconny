*** Strengths

    * Always available
      * ??
      * Offline can be flakey slow

    * Issues (JS)
      * Integers not available
      * Concurrency
      * Privacy
      * Stack access
    * Dart
      * Try Dart online
        * Has to compile the program
      * But can make it faster by using incremental compilation [[http://gilad.try-dart-lang.appspot.com/][here]]
    * The Dart book
      * Isn't ready yet, because the reflection API isn't yet out.
      * The reflection API isn't read because the dart2js output is too
        large.
      * It's hard to know what you're going to call if you allow
        reflection.
      * In other languages you don't have to worry about keeping
        programs under 200kb.
    * Other
