* Big data on AWS

** Intro to services

   Going through EC2, Route 53, S3 and so on.

** What is big data?

   * When you have to start innovating with data collection, storage,
     usage then you have a big data problem.
   * Depends on who is using it.
   * Rate of expansion is increasing exponentially.

** EMR

   * Hadoop on AWS
   * Hadoop cluster launched on average every five seconds.

** Kinesis

   * Makes data available in real time
   * What is real time?
     * Depends - micro second to five minute?
   * Multiple devices writing in
     * Simple because many devices will be low power
   * Bunch of readers processing the data
   * Records exist for only 24h
   * Each shard ingests at up to 1 MB/s or 1000 tps
   * Each shart outputs at up to 2 MB/s or 2000 tps

*** Terminology

    * Stream
    * Shard
      * Every stream has at least one shard
    * Connector
      * Transforms from Kinesis format to output format

** Redshift

   * Redshift understands snowflake and star schemas and automatically
     optimises for them
   * There are as many slices as there are CPUs
     * By default it's round robin
     * Use a distribution key to choose how the rows get distributed per
       slice.
     * You can put nodes from different tables on the same slice.

** Data pipeline

** Hands on
